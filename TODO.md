# TODO — C9911 gap implementation tracker

Working tracker for the standing goal: migrate the actionable gaps from
[C9911.md](C9911.md) (the `mcc:✗`/`mcc:~` items where mcc diverges from the
gcc==clang consensus) into here, implement them easiest-first, and **remove each
item once it is completely implemented and verified** — the permanent landed
record lives in C9911.md's *Landed* appendix sections (and git history).

**C9911.md is partly stale** (generated before some merges): several items it
flags as `mcc:✗` are already fixed. So *re-verify every candidate 3-way against
the live binary* before implementing — confirm it's a real gap, prune it if not.
Each fix ships a cli/exec regression test; keep full ctest + the byte-identical
self-host fixpoint green. (C9911's Appendix holds the *deliberate* DIFFs — those
are intentional and out of scope.)

Legend: `[ ]` open · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done (then removed).

## Open items

*(none — every actionable C9911 gap is migrated and resolved. Finished items are
removed from this file as the goal directs; see C9911.md's "Landed" sections for
the full record, most recently **Landed round 3**: §6.10.8.3 `__STDC_UTF_16__`/
`__STDC_UTF_32__` predefined on all targets, and §7.26.1p3 `thread_local` in the
bundled `<threads.h>` shim.)*

## Remaining C9911 `mcc:✗`/`mcc:~` markers — classified, not open

The residual divergence markers in C9911.md are **not** actionable consensus
gaps; they need no migration:

- **`mcc:✗(consensus) gcc:✗ clang:✗`** — the Annex G `_Imaginary`-type rows
  (§G.2–G.7). No compiler implements the optional imaginary types; no divergence.
- **UB / recommended-practice only** — e.g. §7.16.1.4p3 (`va_arg` second-arg UB),
  §6.4.4.2p7 (hex-float-inexact *recommended* diagnostic). No required diagnostic.
- **No gcc==clang consensus** — e.g. §6.7.4p2/p3 inline-definition constraints
  (gcc and clang disagree / are `~`); mcc matching one side is defensible.
- **Permissive-by-default, diagnoses under `-Werror`** — implicit decls, K&R
  implicit-int, etc.: mcc warns (errors under `-Werror`), matching its documented
  philosophy; C9911 counted the exit-0 default as accept.
- **Deliberate divergences** — recorded in C9911.md's Appendix (out of scope).
