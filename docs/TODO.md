# AST first phase (docs/AST.md §16 "Short" + §17 replay-driver bring-up)

The intention IR alongside the CST. Gated by CMake `CONFIG_AST` (ON by default),
built as a pure side-channel like the CST — `-O0` stays a one-pass parse+compile
flow and byte-identical; `-O1` builds the AST and replays it through the existing
vstack API (`vpushi`/`gen_op`/`gv`/`vstore`/`gsym`/`gjmp`). The gate is the existing
`tests/exec` goldens re-run as an `-O1-replay` column asserting the same `expect`,
brought up one §17 category at a time.

- [x] **A1 — `CONFIG_AST` scaffolding.** CMake `MCC_AST` option (ON), `CONFIG_AST=1`
  define, `ast` preset, `libmcc.c` includes `src/mccast.c` (guarded); mccbuild
  `--ast` + BUILD.md node/preset rows so the config-drift gates stay green.
- [x] **A2 — `src/mccast.{c,h}` intention-IR library.** The 15 node kinds; per-function
  SoA arena (D-c: minimal, no hash-cons yet); builder API; textual `ast_dump`;
  CST-provenance id per node (§14); `ast_validate`. Self-contained (malloc un-poison).
- [x] **A3 — `tools/asttool.c` pure-lib TDD harness + `ast/*` ctests.** 5 suites
  (arena/validate/dump/cfg/provenance), 30 checks. Full `ast`-preset ctest 865/865.
- [~] **A4 — replay driver (`ast_replay_body`) over the vstack API.** In `gen_function`,
  when `MCC_AST_REPLAY` is set: build the intention tree while the parser runs, then
  **discard the parser's body emission** (`ind = body_ind`) and re-emit from the AST
  through the vstack API. **Byte-verify safety net (§17 straight-line tripwire):** the
  re-emitted body is compared to the parser's `-O0` bytes; on *any* mismatch the parser's
  emission is restored verbatim (bytes + `ind` + `rsym`). So correctness never depends on
  having modeled every vstack op — an unmodeled construct (unary `-`, a call, control
  flow) just diverges and falls back. Faithful captures re-emit **byte-for-byte identical**
  to `-O0` (the zero-template invariant, demonstrated). Off by default; `-O0` untouched.
  **Coverage: 25 / 239 exec golden source files have ≥1 function that faithfully replays**
  (return of int constants / param+local integer arithmetic incl. `+ - * / % & | ^ << >>`
  and the `~` desugaring); the rest fall back. Full ast-preset ctest 1149/1149.
  - [x] rung 1: `return <integer-constant>;` → `vpushi`/`gfunc_return`/`gjmp`.
  - [x] rung 2: **integer-arithmetic return trees** (`return argc + 41;`,
    `return 2+3*4;`) via a **scoped vstack-mirror**: `ast_hook_vpush`/`ast_hook_genop`
    shadow the vstack during the return expression, capturing `Literal`/`Ref`/`Binary`;
    `gen_op` is modeled atomically (internal traffic ignored via `ast_in_op`, re-synced
    at its exit); unmodeled in-place transforms (`gen_cast`/`indir`/`gaddrof`) and
    non-reconstructable leaves (registers/symbols/floats) trip `ast_desync` → fall back.
    Leaves restricted to int-constants + frame-relative locals/params (re-push exactly
    after discard). Corpus column caught + drove fixes (cleanup/enum). Fixtures:
    `retexpr` (folds), `argc_expr` (param arithmetic).
  - [ ] rung 3: locals (`Store` capture for `int a=...;`), then calls (`Invoke` →
    printf) — needs replay to own relocations before discard can cover them.
- [~] **A5 — parser AST-build hooks.** `ast_hook_stmt` (count + bail on unsupported
  leaf statements) and `ast_hook_return` (capture Return of an int constant) fire from
  the parser's statement/return positions, gated by `CONFIG_AST` + `ast_active`. Grows
  alongside A4's rungs.
- [~] **A6 — differential-exec replay gate (two layers, both green).**
  - `tests/ast/replay.cmake` — targeted fixtures that must *actually* replay (dump
    fired, not fall back): `ret42`/`ret0`/`retexpr`/`mainempty`.
  - **`exec-replay/*` column** — the whole `tests/exec` golden corpus (280) re-run
    with `MCC_AST_REPLAY=1`, asserting the same expected output. Functions the driver
    can lower go through the AST; everything else falls back to `-O0`, so the column
    stays green as the driver grows. Replay-induced safety verified: the discard is
    guarded by no-new-locals + no-new-relocations + pure-constant-return, so a body
    with a call / cleanup / global store (e.g. cleanup.c `test_ret`) correctly falls
    back instead of dropping work. Full ctest 1148/1148.
  - Next: widen the *replayed* set (not just fallback) toward §17 curriculum 1
    `expressions` → 6 long tail as the driver reaches locals/calls/CFG.
- [ ] **A7 — first template = const-fold**, sequenced *after* the corpus is green
  under zero-template replay, with its own §15 per-template differential test. (Deferred
  to the end of the first phase.)

# Now

- [ ] Normalize as much of the CMake code as possible: 1) minimize gating instead preferring autodetecting the existence of tools and enabling as many tests/targets/configs as are available on the host, 2) reduce CMake usage by relying on `tools` where advantageous, 3) fold in separate .cmake files into CMakeLists.txt
- [ ] **`exec/tls` skipped on arm64+WIN32 (`skipon=arm64/WIN32`, 2026-07-05).**
  On the `msvc / arm64` runner, `exec/tls` intermittently hung (ctest 63 min,
  manual cancel). Root cause is **not** in mcc: **MSVC's arm64 code generator
  miscompiles mcc itself** on the static-`__thread` emission path. The
  MSVC-arm64-built `mcc.exe` nondeterministically drops functions when it
  compiles a `__thread` TU (`tls.c`): some builds/runs lose `main`, others
  truncate a trampoline → the linked exe hangs. Isolation was exhaustive and
  conclusive:
  - mcc's arm64 codegen is **correct** — the same mcc source built by **gcc**
    (x86_64 *and* arm64 Linux) and by **MSVC-x64 cross-targeting arm64-win32**
    all emit a byte-identical, deterministic, correct `tls.s` (50×/30× runs).
  - No mcc source UB: Valgrind clean; `-ftrivial-auto-var-init=pattern` clean.
  - Only **MSVC's arm64 backend building mcc** fails, and it is build/run
    nondeterministic (a later CI build was 0/30 corrupt), so it cannot be
    reproduced or bisected without an arm64 Windows + MSVC box.
  - `exec/tls` still runs (and passes) on **x86_64 WIN32** and on every gcc/clang
    arm64 target, so `__thread` codegen stays covered. The `msvc` ctest step also
    carries `--timeout 300` so any future flaky hang fails fast instead of
    stalling the job.
  - **Tried and reverted (435087ee):** a scoped `#pragma optimize("", off)` around
    the arm64 TLS-access codegen (`arm64_tls_base_x30` + `load`/`store`) did **not**
    fix the hang (`exec/tls` still timed out), so the miscompiled construct is
    *outside* that region. It also used raw `_MSC_VER`/`_M_ARM64`, which the
    `host-gate-invariant` test forbids outside `src/mcchost.{h,c}` — any future
    host-conditional must route through an `MCC_HOST_*` macro defined there.
  - _Next (needs arm64 Windows + MSVC):_ bisect the miscompiled mcc construct.
    A whole-mcc-TU `/Od` on that build is the last-resort blunt workaround, but
    the earlier `MCC_NOOPT` `/Od`-vs-`/O2` probe was inconclusive (the intermittent
    corruption did not reproduce that run), so even that is unverified.
- [ ] **Reconcile divergent test-count claims across docs (validate).**
  `docs/NOTES.md` "Build status" (39/39, 22/22 and 782/782 / 520/520) vs its
  Profiling §7 validation matrix (804/772) cite different totals with no stated
  basis (all three moved out of README/PROFILING in the 2026-07-06 reorg).
  → Regenerate from one `ctest -N` per host/preset and state the per-case vs
  aggregate counting basis; make the docs cite the same source of truth.
- [ ] **Trace the "~100× faster than gcc -O2" headline to a measurement (validate).**
  `README.md:15` says "~100×"; `docs/NOTES.md` Profiling §4b measures 118–204×
  (TU/opt dependent); the NOTES.md "Compile speed & footprint" table shows
  108–141×. → Pick the documented benchmark and make the headline a measured
  range, not a round number.
- [ ] **Re-measure & date-stamp the README speed/size table post-lexer-change
  (validate).** The `docs/NOTES.md` "Compile speed & footprint" table (0.05 s;
  7/19/108/141×) and the ~0.6 MB / ~1.3 MB size claims (`README.md:16` + that
  table) predate the `TOK_HASH_SIZE` change and are toolchain/host-sensitive. →
  Re-run `mccbench` + `size`/`strip` a `dist-*` build; refresh, noting the host
  as PROFILING does.
- [ ] **Regenerate the dated "all green" status prose from CI (validate).**
  `docs/NOTES.md` "Build status" (moved from README) narrates per-preset
  pass/skip counts across ~35 presets; this rots silently. → Derive from the
  latest workflow run, or add a check that fails when the prose diverges from
  actual CTest output.
- [ ] **`va_start` non-last / `register` param check never fires on x86_64
  (impl).** `C9911.md:3215` §7.16.1.4p3 — the SysV macro (`__builtin_va_start` in
  `runtime/include/mccdefs.h`) reads the reg-save area from the frame and never
  references `parmN`, so the misuse diagnostic (present on arm64/riscv64/PE via
  the real `TOK_builtin_va_start` case) is absent on x86_64-SysV and i386.
  → _Deferred:_ making the check target-independent needs x86_64-SysV to lower
  `va_start` through the real builtin (implement `gen_va_start` for SysV) instead
  of the frame-address macro — a codegen rework of the primary target's varargs
  for a diagnostic-only gain; not worth the risk without a driving need.
  Reference test to mirror once fixed: gcc `c-c++-common/Wvarargs-2.c`
  (`va_start` on a non-last / fixed-arg param). See docs/TESTS.md §6-A.3.
- [ ] **External (SHN_UNDEF) thread-local symbols hard-error on Mach-O — TLV
  imports unimplemented (impl).** `src/objfmt/mccmacho.c:2099`. Locally-defined
  `__thread` works (TLV descriptors via `__tlv_bootstrap`); cross-module
  `extern __thread` errors. Documented as an intentional limitation in
  `docs/NOTES.md` (Platform ABI & runtime notes) — revisit only if a real
  cross-module-TLS-on-Darwin need appears; the fix is emitting TLV *import*
  descriptors.
- [ ] **ARM far-branch has no veneer — errors past ±32 MB (fix).**
  `src/arch/arm/arm-gen.c:326` `"FIXME: function bigger than 32MB"`. → Emit a
  long-branch trampoline/island, or downgrade to a documented diagnostic (not FIXME).
- [ ] **i386 fastcall/thiscall: non-register arg before a register arg
  unsupported (impl).** `src/arch/i386/i386-gen.c:530`. → Handle the
  spilled-then-register ordering, or document the accepted ABI limitation.
- [ ] **Validate the remaining i386 TLS + x86_64 32[S] large-address pattern
  assumptions (validate).** x86_64 GD/LD/IE/LE is now covered by the `tls-models`
  ctest (`tests/tls/`, links gcc/clang objects in all four models, dynamic +
  static) — that push fixed real bugs: TLSGD→LE used only the symbol's own
  section size for the TP offset (wrong with a 2nd TLS section), and static GD/LD
  links failed on `__tls_get_addr` (relaxed away, now resolved to 0). STILL OPEN:
  (a) the i386 `R_386_TLS_GD/LDM` pattern paths (`i386-link.c`) need an i386 cross
  build to exercise; (b) the `R_X86_64_32[S] out of range` check (`x86_64-link.c`)
  has no positive test — needs a >2 GB text/data layout to trigger. → Add an i386
  TLS gate under the cross preset, and a forced-high-address link case.
- [ ] **ARM inline-asm `long long` operands unimplemented (impl).**
  `src/arch/arm/arm-asm.c:2465` hard-errors — handle the 64-bit register-pair case.
- [ ] **arm64 inline assembler errors on unmodeled mnemonics (impl).**
  `src/arch/arm64/arm64-asm.c:1877` (+ `:1298/:1441/:1651`). → Enumerate the common
  missing mnemonics; expand the table or document the supported subset.
- [ ] **Resolve/remove the 6 permanently-masked ARM asm encodings (fix).**
  `ARM_KNOWN_FAIL` (tools/mccharness.c:2540) never fails on `bl r3`, `b r3`,
  `mov #0xEFFF`, `mov #0x0201`, two `vmov.f32` forms — real encoding defects. → Fix
  the `mov #imm`/`vmov.f32` cases and drop the entries.
- [ ] **Reference-harness `exec`/`diff3` goldens are effectively dead (validate).**
  `tests/exec/goldens.h:19/53/54/62` (inline multi-unit, backtrace, btdll, alias)
  carry full expected output but SKIP for lack of a reference harness. → Confirm
  each is exercised elsewhere (mcctest/diff); otherwise wire up the harness.
- [ ] **Windows keeps diagnostic color off unconditionally (validate).**
  src/mcchost.c:21 — suppresses color even on VT-enabled Windows Terminal. →
  Probe `ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_PROCESSING`; confirm `-fdiagnostics-color=always`
  still forces it. Low priority.
- [ ] `-fverbose-asm`-style operand comments: meaningful comments need
  codegen-side variable/spill metadata that is discarded after emission;
  classified low-value (reloc symbol names are already printed). Revisit
  only if a debugging workflow materializes that needs it.
- [ ] **CST slice-I symbol resolution is last-declaration-wins (validate/decide).**
  NOTES CST slice I: no scope stack, so a name shadowed across scopes can
  mis-resolve `use→def`. the CST D4 gap analysis flagged this for a failing `sym_ref` shadowing
  fixture to force the decision. → Add the shadowing test; either build a scope
  stack or record the limitation as intentional with the test as the boundary.
- [ ] **CST slice-J macro-invocation v1 imprecisions (validate/decide).**
  NOTES CST slice J: function-like invocations may drop the trailing `)`, and
  object-like macros used inside another macro's args stay plain tokens. Round-trip
  still holds. the CST D4 gap analysis flagged failing tests to decide fix-vs-keep. → Add the
  fixtures; fix or record as accepted v1 with the test pinning the boundary.
- [ ] **CST 5B incremental splice + `H_e` epoch hash are designed, not built (impl).**
  NOTES CST §3.1/§10: the invertible epoch hash + tombstone sweep (O(1)-per-level
  incremental rehash for live edits) and the 5B splice are reserved (slot-key field
  + frontier-scoped `H_s`-recompute ship) but unbuilt; they're LSP/5B-era and gated
  on 4B rolling-hash + error-recovery + `Error`/`Missing` nodes. → Build when the
  LSP consumer lands. Note: D3 repurposed `slot_key` for branch tags, so an `H_e`
  build must reconcile that column's dual use.
- [ ] **Write `docs/CONFIG.md` reconciling code preprocessor names vs. CMake
  config (doc/tooling).** Enumerate every unique preprocessor name in the codebase
  — `#define`/`#ifdef`/`#if defined` macros, especially the `CONFIG_MCC_*` family
  (~30 in `src/`) and any `MCC_*` build/host gates — and cross-check them against
  the CMake config surface (the 55 `mcc_config_node` declarations in
  `CMakeLists.txt`, the `target_compile_definitions`, and preset/cache flags).
  Flag: (a) `CONFIG_MCC_*`/`MCC_*` macros the code reads but no `mcc_config_node`
  defines (undocumented/implicit), (b) config nodes defined but never read,
  (c) name-drift between the CMake option and the emitted `-D`. Prefer a `tools/`
  checker (mirror `tools/hostgate.c` / `ckbuildmd.c`) that greps both sides and
  fails on divergence, so CONFIG.md can't rot. → Then update `docs/BUILD.md` (which
  already tables the CMake nodes, §3–§14) to become the ongoing source of truth for
  in-code flags, cross-linked to CONFIG.md, and wire the checker into ctest.
- [ ] **ARM (32-bit) direct branch can't reach past ±32MB — no veneers (impl).**
  `encbranch` in `src/arch/arm/arm-gen.c` encodes `B`/`BL` with the 24-bit signed
  word displacement (±32MB reach); a target farther than that is currently a hard
  `mcc_error("branch target out of range ...")` (formerly a `FIXME:` inline
  comment, moved here 2026-07-07). Real toolchains instead synthesize a *veneer*
  (a long-branch trampoline island: load the absolute target into a scratch reg
  and `BX`, or an inline literal-pool `LDR pc,[pc,#-4]`) so arbitrarily large
  images link. → When an image that large actually surfaces, emit a veneer for
  out-of-reach `B`/`BL` instead of erroring; until then the error is the pinned
  boundary. The arm64 backend has the same limit as a plain
  `mcc_error("branch out of range")` (`src/arch/arm64/arm64-gen.c:241`) and would
  want the matching treatment.

# C99/C11 test-coverage backlog (from docs/TESTS.md)

Each item ports/mirrors a specific gcc/clang conformance test into an mcc test —
runtime cases go in `tests/exec/features_c99_c11/`, diagnostics/negatives in
`tests/diff/parts/` (or a new reject corpus). Reference paths are relative to
`~/Projects/gcc/gcc/testsuite` (gcc) and `~/Projects/llvm-project/clang/test/C`
(clang). Context + gap matrix: docs/TESTS.md §5–§6. The `va_start` diagnostic gap
(§6-A.3) is tracked with its own item above.

## Real semantic/diagnostic gaps — fix mcc, then add the test

- [ ] **§6.7.4p6 — plain `inline` w/o external definition emits a global (fix+test).**
  An `-O0` call to an inline-only function *links* in mcc (rc 0) where gcc/clang fail
  with `undefined reference` (rc 1): an inline definition is not an external
  definition. Fix the linkage semantics, then add a 2-TU test asserting the call is
  unresolved (and that adding `extern` makes it resolve). _Ref:_ gcc
  `gcc.dg/inline-20.c` (C99 `-fno-gnu89-inline` emission, `scan-assembler`),
  `gcc.dg/inline-15.c`, `gcc.dg/inline-19.c`.
- [ ] **§6.9.1p6 — K&R identifier-list params default to `int` with only a warning
  (fix+test).** `int g(x){return x;}` compiles in mcc (rc 0); gcc `-std=c11` and
  clang reject (C99 removed implicit int). Promote to a default-mode error; add a
  reject test. _Ref:_ gcc `gcc.dg/c99-impl-int-1.c`, `c99-impl-int-2.c`,
  `c11-old-style-definition-1.c`, `c11-unproto-1.c`.
- [ ] **§7.26.1 — bundled `<threads.h>` shadows the system header (fix).** mcc's
  `include/threads.h` resolves ahead of glibc's (`-M` confirms), the root of the
  `c11_threads` divergence. Fix header-search precedence / align the shim. _No direct
  gcc/clang test to port_ (mcc-internal include-path behavior); validate against the
  existing `tests/exec/features_c99_c11/c11_threads.c`. See docs/TESTS.md §6-A.4.

## Coverage-depth gaps — mcc passes but under-tests vs gcc/clang; add tests

- [~] **UCN-in-identifier breadth.** Basic runtime is already covered by
  `tests/exec/lexical/ucn_identifiers.c` (`\u`/`\U` escapes, raw UTF-8, raw≡escaped
  equivalence). *Remaining = the ~30 gcc edge cases: invalid-UCN rejection
  (basic-latin range), UCN in different token positions, normalization* — mostly
  diagnostics → negative-test tier. _Ref:_ gcc `gcc.dg/ucnid-*.c`; clang
  `C99/n717.c` (UCN grammar), `C11/n1518.c` (UAX#31).
- [ ] **FP Annex F wide-return intermediate precision.** `FLT_EVAL_METHOD` itself
  is done (`flt_eval_method.c`, migrated to NOTES); this is the remaining per-target
  piece — verify wide intermediate-precision return conformance (Annex F/§5.2.4.2.2).
  _Ref:_ gcc `gcc.dg/c11-float-*.c` (wide-return cases), clang `C11/n1365.c`,
  `C11/n1396.c` (per-target IR).
- [ ] **`_Complex` diagnostics + Annex G special values.** mcc is arithmetic/ABI
  strong but light on constraint diagnostics and CMPLX/NaN/inf edge cases. _Ref:_
  clang `C11/n1464.c` (CMPLX/`__builtin_complex`), `C11/n1514.c` (Annex G); gcc
  `gcc.dg/c99-complex-{1,3}.c`.
- [~] **Negative/diagnostic test tier.** _Established_ in `tests/cli/cases.h`
  (grep-the-message pattern): `c99_fam_not_last`, `c11_alignas_underalign`,
  `c99_vla_goto_into_scope`, `c99_vla_switch_into_scope`, `c11_noreturn_returns`.
  *Remaining: broaden toward the ~70% of gcc's C99/C11 files that are `dg-error`
  negatives* — the highest-volume seed is gcc `gcc.dg/c99-typespec-1.c` (1055
  dg-error over every type-specifier combo), plus `c11-align-3.c` and the
  `c99-flex-array-*` / `c11-*` negative files.
