      REF: DETAILS.md#t-lin-10001-slice-3a-the-pool-job-becomes-a-tick | DEPS: — | NOTE: hold released by win-x64; slice 3a DONE at c6c26c64 (job->run is now job->tick, quit re-read between ticks, behaviour identical, 79/79 green). Slice 3b = split sd_job_heavy + the bound assertion + reconcile jit/selftest-shutdown's `done == accepted`, which IS the unbounded property written as a requirement — all one unit, see DETAILS

- [ ] T-lin-10042 [X] mac-arm64 — the Metal parity staged plan, WITH fp64 (2,200-3,400 lines)
      OWNER: — | STATE: OPEN | SHA: 0d33d71e | TS: 2026-08-15T02:20Z
      REF: DETAILS.md#q-lin-10009-answer-metal-parity-scheduled-with-fp64 | DEPS: — | Q: Q-lin-10009 ANSWERED | NOTE: human scheduled the fp64 variant. No CI differential exists or can — land it in slices each checkable by the hand-run per-value differential, not as one unwatched arm. SCOPING (mac-arm64, 2026-08-15): it is EXTEND-not-rebuild — the MSL base survives (345 `msl_*` refs across src/mccgpu.{c,h}, mccslice.h, mccfmt.h) and its per-value differential RUNS natively on this M1 (gpu/msl-slice-differential + -known-positive + -real all green here; the hand-run tool is tools/slicerun.c). So the per-slice verification path is confirmed feasible on-box; the work is the ~2200-line MSL/SPIR-V parity gap + fp64. FIRST-SLICE POINTERS: the MSL emitter is in src/mccgpu.h (macro/inline-heavy — msl_iv/bv/pv value builders at ~260-340, msl_arith/guard_div/widen/int_of_bool), the SPIR-V arm + differential in tools/slicerun.c; fp64 is ALREADY partially present in BOTH (mccgpu.h ~1330-1447 `f64`, slicerun.c ~109/452-471/804 Float64/double), so this is op-by-op parity completion, not greenfield fp64. Method for slice 1: diff the two arms' op coverage against the gpu/msl-slice-differential corpus, take the smallest fp64 op MSL lowers differently than SPIR-V, close it, hand-run the per-value differential. Wants a fresh dedicated start (per its own "not one unwatched arm"), not a session-tail rush

SPLIT: the `arm-win32` (ARM32) half has NO executor — Windows 11 on ARM64 does not run ARM32 apps — and must not be reported green with the arm64 half
- [ ] T-win-50003 [S] win-x64 full native suite — 35 real failures triaged (28 GPU-slice/`slicerun` device↔CPU differentials + "0 slices on Windows"; 4 fp under emitsize/emitiso opt-search; 3 jit/runtime)
