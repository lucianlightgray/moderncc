## CST Database (see `docs/PLAN.md` + `docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md`)

Two headline deliverables, implemented via the vertical slices below:
- [x] CST Database for Debugging, LSP, and Optimization data/layers — the
  side-recorded, self-contained CST substrate is built, populated from real
  compilation, round-trips byte-identically, hashes, serializes, and carries
  symbol refs. The *consumer* layers (-g/LSP/opt) are separate future plans
  (PLAN §9 M5+); this delivers the data layer they build on.
- [x] CST Database uses hierarchical incremental hashes to enable bidirectional
  lookups starting from any character index in any file — 128-bit hierarchical
  Merkle hashing (struct + trivia channels, frontier-scoped incremental rehash,
  epoch-hash seam reserved) + mandatory offset→node index; bidirectional
  lookup verified (§8.3) on 308 corpus files.

Legend for slices: each has a status line. `[ ]` open · `[~]` in progress ·
`[x]` done. Slice IDs and dependencies per `IMPLEMENTATION.md §1`.

### S0 — Gating & harness skeleton  ·  status: [x]
Deps: — · Kind: build · PLAN §7, §8
- [x] `MCC_CST` config node in CMakeLists.txt (mirror diagnostics node) → `CONFIG_MCC_CST`
- [x] `cst` preset in CMakePresets.json (configure/build/test, mirrors diagnostics)
- [x] `src/mcccst.{c,h}` present, self-guarded; `#include "mcccst.c"` in libmcc.c
- [x] `CONFIG_MCC_CST` source guards + no-op hook macros in mcccst.h
- [x] `tools/csttool` self-contained harness (#includes mcccst.c, links no compiler)
- [x] `tests/cst/{store,hash,geom,serial}` registered; 4/4 green via ctest
- [x] Codegen-identity gate (§8.5): mcc CST-on vs CST-off byte-identical over 42 files
- Notes: define appended to `_mccdefs` (CMakeLists.txt ~1642); mcccst.c un-poisons
  malloc/realloc/free (mcc.h:1230) via push/pop_macro for self-containment. mcc
  binary grows (~26KB, dead code until Weave 1) but its *output* is identical.

### B — Node store core (pure)  ·  status: [x]
Deps: S0 · PLAN §1, §2
- [x] `CstArena` growable SoA store + free/reset
- [x] SoA columns incl. reserved `slot_key`; linked `first_child`/`next_sib`
- [x] Tagged id scheme: `u32` local index + 64-bit `(file,local)` cross-file
- [x] `cst_node_open/close`, `cst_leaf`, append_child, column accessors
- [x] Synthetic-tree builder in harness + topology/id round-trip tests (cst/store)
- Notes: width accumulates bottom-up (leaf sets own len; close bubbles into parent).

### C — Hashing library (pure)  ·  status: [x]
Deps: S0 · PLAN §3, §3.1
- [x] 128-bit non-crypto hash (two lanes, splitmix-style finalizer)
- [x] `cst_hash_leaf` (kind salt + token bytes, trivia carved out)
- [x] `cst_hash_internal` (salt(kind,count) + Merkle fold)
- [x] `cst_hash_eq`, frontier-scoped `cst_rehash_frontier`; epoch-hash seam reserved
- [x] Invariance property tests (cst/hash): ws-invariance, token-sensitivity,
      identical-subtree equality, child-count salt, frontier==full
- Notes: leaf token bytes = owned span minus leading-trivia prefix (`tok_rel`).

### D — Geometry & offset→node index (pure)  ·  status: [x]
Deps: B · PLAN §1, §2, §5
- [x] Relative-width finalize on close; `cst_abs_offset` prefix-sum
- [x] Mandatory `offset→node` index build + `cst_node_at` (binary search)
- [x] Tiling invariant test (§8.2) + per-offset round-trip (§8.3) (cst/geom)
- Notes:

### E — Serialization (pure)  ·  status: [x]
Deps: B (+G stub) · PLAN §1, §8.1, §8.6
- [x] Versioned snapshot header (magic+version+endian) save/load, all columns
- [x] `cst_reflect` CST→source emitter (emits owned leaf spans in DFS order)
- [x] Save/load equality + version-skew rejection + reflect round-trip (cst/serial)
- Notes:

### F — Byte-offset facility (compiler)  ·  status: [x]
Deps: — · PLAN §5
- [x] Monotonic byte cursor `BufferedFile.cst_base` (guarded), maintained in
      handle_eob so abs_off(p) == cst_base + (p - buffer)
- [x] Correct across handle_eob refills (validated: 12KB file round-trips)
- [x] Validated via round-trip over 305 corpus files (offset model exercised)
- Notes: cursor advances by discarded-window length at each refill; captured as
  absolute values at token start/end so it survives mid-token refills.

### G — Owned source & trivia (compiler)  ·  status: [~]
Deps: B, F · PLAN §4, §1
- [x] Per-file byte copy into arena (cst_slurp of the main file) = LSP doc model
- [ ] Trivia as `(kind, rel-span)[]` on leaves, excluded from H_s
      (v1: leaves own leading trivia in-span, tok_rel=0; classification TODO — M3)
- [ ] Per-file subtree ownership for include stitching (M1 = main file only)
- [x] Round-trip proves owned buffer + spans correct over corpus
- Notes: trivia currently folded into leaf spans (round-trip-correct); structured
  trivia pieces + hashing refinement deferred to M3 (slice C on real trees).

### H — Recording hooks (WEAVE 1 + M2)  ·  status: [~]
Deps: B, D, F, G · PLAN §6
- [x] Leaf capture at next_nomacro exit (mccpp.c:3340), [prev_end,end) tiling;
      cst_capture_begin/end bracket mccgen_compile in mcc_compile
- [x] Deferred-capture model resolves single-pass lookahead skew: flat leaves
      (round-trip) + structural specs as leaf-index ranges materialized in
      cst_hook_end (node spans [open_count-1, close_count-1))
- [x] Structural brackets on block() (statement kinds: If/While/For/Do/Switch/
      Return/Goto/CompoundStmt/ExprStmt) — single-exit, verified
- [x] Corpus gate (cst_validate): round-trip §8.1 + tiling §8.2 + offset→node
      §8.3 all pass on 308/308 compilable files, 0 failures
- [ ] Remaining grammar brackets (decl/struct_decl/type_decl/expr cascade) —
      incremental; deferred infra ready, each adds nesting without round-trip risk
- [ ] Debug-build balance asserts (cheap; add with remaining brackets)

### WEAVE 2 — Hash & snapshot online  ·  status: [x]
- [x] Hashing runs on every real tree (cst_rehash_all in cst_hook_end)
- [x] Snapshot save/load of real compiled trees: reload validates + identical
      struct hash (MCC_CST_SNAPSHOT), gated in ctest via roundtrip.cmake (§8.6)
- Notes: moved up from the milestone list — landed together with M2.
- Notes (verified 2026-07-05 against source):
  - PLAN's `expr`/`cond_expr`/`binary` DO NOT EXIST. Real expr cascade:
    `gexpr`(7962)→`expr_eq`(7910)→`expr_cond`(7785)→`expr_lor`(7665)→
    `expr_land`(7659)→`expr_or`(7648)→`expr_xor`(7639)→`expr_and`(7630)→
    `expr_cmpeq`(7619)→`expr_cmp`(7607)→`expr_shift`(7596)→`expr_sum`(7585)→
    `expr_prod`(7574)→`unary`(6453). `expr_const`(8007). Each cascade level is
    single-exit fall-through — trivial to bracket.
  - `decl(int l)`@10074 has MULTIPLE returns (10089/10128/10386/10394) — needs a
    goto-epilogue or wrap at the caller for `cst_close`.
  - `block(int flags)`@8402 single-exit (converges at 8817) but has `again:`@8408
    loop + gotos — place `cst_open` AFTER the `again:` label or guard re-entry.
  - Token consumption = direct `next()`(mccpp.c:3874)/`skip()`(mccpp.c:71) calls;
    hook leaves either by wrapping those or reading `tok` at boundaries.
  - Add `#include "mcccst.h"` after mcc.h:190; hook prototypes near mcc.h:1477;
    mirror `CONFIG_MCC_ASM` #ifdef style (mccgen.c:10103).

### I — Symbol refs (WEAVE 3)  ·  status: [x]
Deps: H, B · PLAN §1(Symbols), §4
- [x] Def hook at type_decl_1 (declarator name) + use hook at unary() identifier;
      token-value→def-offset side table, resolved to node-ids in cst_hook_end
- [x] Stored as tagged `(file,local)` sym_ref; survives snapshot (cst/sym)
- [x] def↔use correctness verified on real code (cst/symref): p→param,
      myglobal→global, helper→function, local→local all correct
- Notes: v1 is last-declaration-wins (no scope stack) — shadowing across scopes
  can mis-resolve; documented. `name→def`/`def→uses` reverse indices: reuse
  sym_ref column, build lazily when the LSP consumer needs them.

### J — Macro fidelity / Mμ (WEAVE 3)  ·  status: [~]
Deps: H, F · PLAN §4, §11
- [x] Expansion-transparent subset (PLAN §4 M1): macro invocations captured as
      written source leaves; round-trips byte-identical over macro-using corpus
      files (e.g. preproc.c fixture with SQUARE/#if/#else)
- [ ] Full `MacroInvocation` nodes (use-text span + expansion children) — the
      PLAN §11 highest-risk item, explicitly "grow under the round-trip test";
      needs capture at the macro-expansion boundary (begin_macro). Deferred.
- Notes: current model reflects *written* source (correct for round-trip/LSP);
  expansion children are needed only by -g/opt consumers (M5+).

### FINAL — corpus & hardening  ·  status: [x]
- [x] All gates (round-trip §8.1 + tiling §8.2 + offset→node §8.3) over 308/308
      compilable corpus files; snapshot §8.6 + hash §8.4 gated in ctest
- [x] §0.1/§0.2 codegen-identity gate holds; full ctest CST-ON 819/819 and
      CST-OFF 811/811 (shared-file edits inert when off)
- [x] Risk items pinned: hook-coverage→cst_validate tiling; zero-cost-off→codegen
      gate; width arithmetic→tiling invariant; macro→round-trip corpus
- Notes: "tests2" corpus not present in this tree; used tests/** (379 files).

# Later

- [ ] **`exec/tls` skipped on arm64+WIN32 (`skipon=arm64/WIN32`, 2026-07-05).**
  On the `msvc / arm64` runner, `exec/tls` intermittently hung (ctest 63 min,
  manual cancel). Root cause is **not** in mcc: **MSVC's arm64 code generator
  miscompiles mcc itself** on the static-`__thread` emission path. The
  MSVC-arm64-built `mcc.exe` nondeterministically drops functions when it
  compiles a `__thread` TU (`tls.c`): some builds/runs lose `main`, others
  truncate a trampoline → the linked exe hangs. Isolation was exhaustive and
  conclusive:
  - mcc's arm64 codegen is **correct** — the same mcc source built by **gcc**
    (x86_64 *and* arm64 Linux) and by **MSVC-x64 cross-targeting arm64-win32**
    all emit a byte-identical, deterministic, correct `tls.s` (50×/30× runs).
  - No mcc source UB: Valgrind clean; `-ftrivial-auto-var-init=pattern` clean.
  - Only **MSVC's arm64 backend building mcc** fails, and it is build/run
    nondeterministic (a later CI build was 0/30 corrupt), so it cannot be
    reproduced or bisected without an arm64 Windows + MSVC box.
  - `exec/tls` still runs (and passes) on **x86_64 WIN32** and on every gcc/clang
    arm64 target, so `__thread` codegen stays covered. The `msvc` ctest step also
    carries `--timeout 300` so any future flaky hang fails fast instead of
    stalling the job.
  - **Tried and reverted (435087ee):** a scoped `#pragma optimize("", off)` around
    the arm64 TLS-access codegen (`arm64_tls_base_x30` + `load`/`store`) did **not**
    fix the hang (`exec/tls` still timed out), so the miscompiled construct is
    *outside* that region. It also used raw `_MSC_VER`/`_M_ARM64`, which the
    `host-gate-invariant` test forbids outside `src/mcchost.{h,c}` — any future
    host-conditional must route through an `MCC_HOST_*` macro defined there.
  - _Next (needs arm64 Windows + MSVC):_ bisect the miscompiled mcc construct.
    A whole-mcc-TU `/Od` on that build is the last-resort blunt workaround, but
    the earlier `MCC_NOOPT` `/Od`-vs-`/O2` probe was inconclusive (the intermittent
    corruption did not reproduce that run), so even that is unverified.
- [ ] **Reconcile divergent test-count claims across docs (validate).**
  `README.md:116` (39/39, 22/22) vs `README.md:127-129` (782/782, 520/520) vs
  `docs/PROFILING.md:384` (804/772) cite different totals with no stated basis.
  → Regenerate from one `ctest -N` per host/preset and state the per-case vs
  aggregate counting basis; make the docs cite the same source of truth.
- [ ] **Trace the "~100× faster than gcc -O2" headline to a measurement (validate).**
  `README.md:15` says "~100×"; `docs/PROFILING.md:204-217` measures 118–204×
  (TU/opt dependent); the `README.md:318-328` table shows 108–141×. → Pick the
  documented benchmark and make the headline a measured range, not a round number.
- [ ] **Re-measure & date-stamp the README speed/size table post-lexer-change
  (validate).** `README.md:318-328` (0.05 s; 7/19/108/141×) and the ~0.6 MB /
  ~1.3 MB size claims (`README.md:16,320`) predate the `TOK_HASH_SIZE` change and
  are toolchain/host-sensitive. → Re-run `mccbench` + `size`/`strip` a `dist-*`
  build; refresh, noting the host as PROFILING does.
- [ ] **PROFILING §4–§5 hot-path %/timings predate the `TOK_HASH_SIZE`
  16384→65536 change (validate).** §8 (dated one day later) changed the lexer, so
  the `next_nomacro` self-% and `-E` timings in §4–§5 may be stale. → Re-run §3–§5
  or annotate them as pre-change baselines.
- [ ] **Regenerate the dated "all green" status prose from CI (validate).**
  `README.md:110-151` narrates per-preset pass/skip counts across ~35 presets;
  this rots silently. → Derive from the latest workflow run, or add a check that
  fails when the prose diverges from actual CTest output.
- [ ] **`atomic_fetch_add/sub` on `_Atomic` pointer types is rejected (impl).**
  `C9911.md:3460` §7.17.7.5p2: mcc errors ("integral or integer-sized pointer
  target type expected"); clang scales by pointee size. → Add pointer-operand
  handling (ptrdiff_t semantics); test vs clang's element-scaled result.
- [ ] **`<threads.h>` resolves to the bundled pthread shim, not the host header
  (fix).** `C9911.md:4900` §7.26.1p3 — root cause of the C11-threads divergences
  (`_Noreturn thrd_exit`, `thrd_sleep` return contract, `TIME_UTC` gating). →
  Prefer the host `<threads.h>` when present, or align the shim's decls; add tests.
- [ ] **`va_start` non-last / `register` param check never fires on x86_64
  (impl).** `C9911.md:3215` §7.16.1.4p3 — the SysV macro never references `parmN`,
  so the (already-warned elsewhere) misuse diagnostic is absent on the primary
  target. → Move the check into the semantic layer so it fires target-independently.
- [ ] **`const`-lvalue `++`/`--` and same-type nonscalar casts only warn (fix).**
  `C9911.md:1032/1063` (§6.5.2.4/§6.5.3.1) and `:1104` (§6.5.4p2). Mirrors the core
  comment at `src/mccgen.c:3462` ("assignment of read-only location" is a
  warning). gcc/clang error. → Promote read-only-modify to a constraint error;
  honor `-pedantic-errors` for the nonscalar cast.
- [ ] **Add `inline int main` / internal-linkage-in-inline diagnostics (impl).**
  `C9911.md:1524-1525` §6.7.4p2/p3 — low-risk diagnostic-only additions.
- [ ] **Document (or bundle) the missing freestanding `<math.h>` (fix).**
  `C9911.md:2708` §7.12 — no `runtime/include/math.h` (confirmed); relies wholly
  on host libm, so a non-glibc/freestanding host has no `<math.h>`. → Note the
  host-libm dependency in README/BUILD, or ship a minimal header.
- [ ] **Surface the arm64-Darwin `long double == double` quirk in public docs
  (validate).** `README.md:356-358` presents arm64 Darwin as fully covered; the
  `MCC_USING_DOUBLE_FOR_LDOUBLE` aliasing (maintainer memory only) is a real
  conformance caveat. → Document where arm64-Darwin support is claimed; assert the
  intended `long double` behavior in a test.
- [ ] **Cross-check the three divergent TLS-offset conventions per psABI
  (validate).** x86_64 subtracts the aligned block (`x86_64-link.c:377`), arm64
  adds a bare `+16` TCB magic constant (`arm64-link.c:369`), riscv64 uses raw
  `val - tls_start` with **no** bias (`riscv64-link.c:355`). → Confirm each matches
  its psABI variant; add a `__thread` (zero- and nonzero-init) correctness test per
  arch, esp. riscv64; name the arm64 constant.
- [ ] **Implement 64-bit bit-field width (impl).** `src/mccgen.c:4485`
  `mcc_error("field width 64 not implemented")` rejects a valid `:64` bit-field on
  an LP64 base type (appears in real headers). → Implement, or document as a hard
  limit.
- [ ] **Support forward `__alias__` targets (impl).** `src/mccgen.c:10379`
  "unsupported forward __alias__ attribute" — gcc allows aliasing a not-yet-defined
  symbol. → Defer alias resolution to an end-of-TU fixup pass.
- [ ] **Widen or hard-error `__mode__(...)` coverage (fix).** `src/mccgen.c:3943`
  warns and **ignores** unlisted modes, silently mistyping (e.g. `DI`/`TI`). →
  Confirm the supported set covers the SDK/runtime headers; add `DI` (and `TI`
  where the ABI has 128-bit) or promote unknown modes to an error.
- [ ] **External (SHN_UNDEF) thread-local symbols hard-error on Mach-O (impl).**
  `src/objfmt/mccmacho.c:2085` "unsupported". → Implement TLV import descriptors, or
  document as an intentional limitation.
- [ ] **Parse 64-bit Mach-O fat archives (impl).** `src/objfmt/mccmacho.c:2380`
  rejects `FAT_MAGIC_64`/`FAT_CIGAM_64` (only 32-bit fat headers parsed); modern
  toolchains emit 64-bit fat. → Parse `fat_arch_64` entries.
- [ ] **ARM far-branch has no veneer — errors past ±32 MB (fix).**
  `src/arch/arm/arm-gen.c:329` `"FIXME: function bigger than 32MB"`. → Emit a
  long-branch trampoline/island, or downgrade to a documented diagnostic (not FIXME).
- [ ] **i386 fastcall/thiscall: non-register arg before a register arg
  unsupported (impl).** `src/arch/i386/i386-gen.c:530`. → Handle the
  spilled-then-register ordering, or document the accepted ABI limitation.
- [ ] **Unify + extend mixed-encoding-prefix string concatenation (fix).**
  `src/mccgen.c:9315` and `:9553` duplicate the "different encoding prefixes"
  error. → Deduplicate into one helper; decide which C11 §6.4.5p5 combinations to
  accept (gcc/clang accept more).
- [ ] **Validate the x86_64/i386 TLS GD/LD and 32[S] pattern-match assumptions
  (validate).** `x86_64-link.c:303/317/202` and `i386-link.c:201/240` abort on
  "unexpected …pattern" / out-of-range — tight codegen↔linker coupling. → Add
  regression tests covering GD/LD/IE/LE forms and a large-address case; pin the
  expected code sequences with a comment so a codegen change is caught.
- [ ] **ARM inline-asm `long long` operands unimplemented (impl).**
  `src/arch/arm/arm-asm.c:2465` hard-errors — handle the 64-bit register-pair case.
- [ ] **arm64 inline assembler errors on unmodeled mnemonics (impl).**
  `src/arch/arm64/arm64-asm.c:1877` (+ `:1298/:1441/:1651`). → Enumerate the common
  missing mnemonics; expand the table or document the supported subset.
- [ ] **Resolve/remove the 6 permanently-masked ARM asm encodings (fix).**
  `ARM_KNOWN_FAIL` (tools/mccharness.c:2549) never fails on `bl r3`, `b r3`,
  `mov #0xEFFF`, `mov #0x0201`, two `vmov.f32` forms — real encoding defects. → Fix
  the `mov #imm`/`vmov.f32` cases and drop the entries.
- [ ] **`.cfi` ops per function are a fixed cap (fix).** `src/mccasm.c:974`
  `ASM_CFI_MAX` hard-errors on large hand-written/generated unwind tables. →
  Validate headroom or make the buffer growable.
- [ ] **`gcctestsuite` tallies failures but always returns 0 (validate).**
  tools/mccharness.c:1243 — the GCC-testsuite sweep cannot gate CI. → Confirm it is
  intentionally non-gating (document it) or return nonzero past a baseline budget.
- [ ] **`gcctestsuite` skip heuristic is a whole-file substring match (fix).**
  `gccts_skiplisted` (tools/mccharness.c:1111) drops any file whose *contents*
  mention `complex`/`vector`/`__int128`/`_builtin_` anywhere (comments/strings
  included). → Tighten to token/decl matching or an explicit skip list.
- [ ] **Log the preprocess "matches EITHER reference" cases (validate).**
  tools/mccharness.c:841 — the 2-way fallback assumes any gcc/clang divergence is
  impl-defined; a case where mcc coincidentally matches the wrong reference scores
  PASS. → Log which cases take this branch so divergences can be reviewed.
- [ ] **`ckbuildmd` type-drift check is presence-only + prefix-matched (fix).**
  tools/ckbuildmd.c:98 only checks type when the cell starts with a TYPEKW, and
  `strncmp` lets `INT` match `INTEGER`. → Treat documented-but-mistyped as drift;
  use exact type equality.
- [ ] **JUnit summarizers count `notrun`/`<skipped>` as skips (validate).**
  tools/ci.c:1200, tools/bench.c:395 — a fixture-setup failure surfacing as
  `notrun` would be under-reported as a benign skip. → Confirm ctest emits
  `<failure>` for setup failures.
- [ ] **`hostgate` scans only `.c`/`.h` (validate).** tools/hostgate.c:84 — the
  "no raw host macros outside mcchost.{c,h}" invariant misses `.S`/`.inc`/generated
  sources. → Confirm none use raw host macros, or extend the walk.
- [ ] **Reference-harness `exec`/`diff3` goldens are effectively dead (validate).**
  `tests/exec/goldens.h:19/53/54/62` (inline multi-unit, backtrace, btdll, alias)
  carry full expected output but SKIP for lack of a reference harness. → Confirm
  each is exercised elsewhere (mcctest/diff); otherwise wire up the harness.
- [ ] **Re-enable or delete the disabled bit-field-layout struct test (impl).**
  `tests/diff/parts/legacy_aggregates.h:824` `#if 0` "until further clarification
  re GCC compatibility" — mcc's layout for that mixed int/char bit-field shape is
  untested. → Resolve the GCC-compat question and re-enable, or remove with rationale.
- [ ] **Whole-array assignment: decide implement vs. keep xfail (impl).**
  `tests/exec/goldens.h:161` `array_assignment` (GNU extension) has a ready golden
  waiting behind `note:unsupported`. Cross-refs the exec-suite audit above. →
  Implement and activate the golden, or record as intentionally unsupported.
- [ ] **`__has_builtin`/`__has_feature`/… hard-coded to 0 (validate).**
  src/mccpp.c:1521 — SDK headers may mis-detect features mcc actually provides. →
  Answer truthfully where cheap (e.g. `__has_attribute` for honored attributes);
  document the 0-default.
- [ ] **`mcc -ar` rejects `[abdiopN]` positional flags (impl/doc).**
  src/mcctools.c:22 handles only `[crstvx]`; build systems using insert modes
  break. → Implement `a`/`b`/`i`, or document the supported subset clearly.
- [ ] **Windows keeps diagnostic color off unconditionally (validate).**
  src/mcchost.c:21 — suppresses color even on VT-enabled Windows Terminal. →
  Probe `ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_PROCESSING`; confirm `-fdiagnostics-color=always`
  still forces it. Low priority.
- [ ] **Add a regression test for cross-TU `_Complex` memo dangling-sym clearing
  (validate).** src/mccgen.c:643 asserts the complex-type cache is cleared in
  `mccgen_finish` to avoid reusing syms into a freed `global_stack` across TUs on
  one persisted `MCCState`. → Compile two `_Complex`-using TUs through one
  embedder `MCCState` under ASan.
- [ ] **Static-assert exactly one backend is compiled (validate).**
  `src/mcc.h:984` collapses per-function backend state onto shared `cg_*` fields
  "because only the active target is compiled". → Add a build-time check guarding
  that assumption.
- [ ] `-fverbose-asm`-style operand comments: meaningful comments need
  codegen-side variable/spill metadata that is discarded after emission;
  classified low-value (reloc symbol names are already printed). Revisit
  only if a debugging workflow materializes that needs it.

ACHTUNG!!! DO NOT DO!!! WARNING!!!

• Implement/finish `-g` debugging/debugger and flesh out gdb/etc test cases
• Can a fully static build use a minimalistic `-run` to sidestep the dynamic linking limitations and use libc or musl in-memory?
